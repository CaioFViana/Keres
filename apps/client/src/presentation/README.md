# Presentation Layer

This directory contains UI-related components, screens, and logic that are part of the presentation layer of the client application.

Examples:
- Shared UI components (e.g., custom buttons, input fields)
- Custom hooks for UI logic
- View models or presenters (if applicable)
- Screens that are not directly managed by Expo Router's `app` directory structure.
