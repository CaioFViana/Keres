# Keres - Development Progress Log

This document tracks the ongoing development progress of the Keres project, detailing completed tasks and the next planned steps.

## Current Status

*   **Database Schema:** Updated to support dynamic story structures (added `type` to `story` table, introduced `choices` table). Drizzle migrations generated and applied. `World Rules` schema added and migrated.
*   **Dynamic Story Structures:**
    *   `Choice` entity (domain, repository, use cases, controller, routes) implemented.
    *   `Story` use cases (`CreateStoryUseCase`, `UpdateStoryUseCase`) updated to handle the `type` field.
    *   `Scene` use cases (`CreateSceneUseCase`, `UpdateSceneUseCase`, `DeleteSceneUseCase`) updated to manage implicit choices for linear stories.
*   **Project Configuration:** Root `package.json` scripts updated for Drizzle commands (`db:generate`, `db:migrate`, `db:push`, `db:studio`). `packages/shared` configured for proper compilation and module resolution.
*   **Moment Entity CRUD:** Full CRUD operations (repository, use cases, controller, routes) implemented and integrated.
*   **World Rules Entity CRUD:** Full CRUD operations (schema, domain, repository, use cases, controller, routes) implemented and integrated.
