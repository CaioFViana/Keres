# Infrastructure Layer

This directory contains the concrete implementations of repositories and external services for the client application.

Examples:
- API clients (e.g., `AuthApiRepository.ts`, `StoryApiRepository.ts`)
- Local database access (e.g., `SQLiteAuthRepository.ts`, `SQLiteStoryRepository.ts`)
- Other external service integrations (e.g., file system access, push notifications)
